* An even easier, simpler and versatile CNN alternative to [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).
* Promotes easy learnability and practice of theano.
* Modelling by just entries in the boilerplate.


## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano. This will also be useful for industry when teting out prototypes.

The [wiki](https://github.com/ragavvenkatesan/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/wiki) page has some rudimentary details on how to run the code and how to use it. I am working on a Sphinx Documentation, but until then, thats all I have. Contact me if you had trouble.

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
